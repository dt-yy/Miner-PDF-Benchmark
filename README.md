# Introduction
   MPB (Miner-PDF-Benchmark) is an end-to-end PDF document comprehension evaluation suite designed for large-scale model data scenarios. It ensures human readability at the file granularity and provides PDF categorization tags. The dataset comprises 350 PDF files and 8410 pages of PDFs, including 11 types of datasets such as books, textbooks, academic literature, PPT to PDF, and examination papers. It serves as a reference for evaluating PDF document comprehension capabilities for developers of large-scale model data and tool developers.

# Metrics

We use [metrics](docs/Metric.md) to evaluate the extraction tools.

# Results

We have evaluated extraction tools, including nogout, marker, MinerU, doc2x, ocrmath, and mathpix. The results are as follows.

# Get Data
Datasets can be downloaded from [OpenDataLab](https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/Miner-PDF-Benchmark/tree/main);

# Usage
  
1. Clone the project into your environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/opendatalab/Miner-PDF-Benchmark
cd Miner-PDF-Benchmark
```
2. Install(Python 3.9 is recommended)

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the evaluation set

Download the evaluation set from [OpenDataLab](https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/Miner-PDF-Benchmark/tree/main)(sdk/cli is recommended), and unzip the evaluation set into the `datasets` directory, ensuring the datasets directory contains `pdf` and `annotations`.
After downloading all of them, organize the data as follows:

```
- Miner-PDF-Benchmark/
  - datasets/
    - academic_literature/
      - annotations/
        - academic_literature_xx.md
      - pdf/ 
    - atlas/
      - annotations/
        - atlas_xx.md
      - pdf/
    - ...
  - evaluate_tool/
```

4. Preprocess the evaluation set

Since the images in the evaluation set have not been evaluated yet, you need to execute the following command to preprocess the images:

```
cd evaluate_tool
python clean_photo.py --tool_name annotations --download_dir ../datasets/
```

5. Prepare the datasets for tools to be evaluated

Please copy the `Markdown` file generated by the evaluation tool you need to evaluate to the `datasets/document_types/tool_name` directory. `document_types` is the label corresponding to the 11 categories, and `tool_name` is the name of tools to be evaluated.
The directory structure after copying is as follows:
```
- Miner-PDF-Benchmark/
  - datasets/
    - academic_literature/
      - annotations/
        - academic_literature_xx.md
      - tool_name/
        - academic_literature_xx.md
      - pdf/ 
    - atlas/
      - tool_name/
        - atlas_xx.md
    - ...
```

Execute the following command to preprocess the dataset generated by the tool you want to evaluate:
```
cd evaluate_tool
python clean_photo.py --tool_name tool_name --download_dir ../datasets/
```

6. Calculate the score

Please execute the following command to calculate the score, `--tool_name` is the name of the tool you want to evaluate, `--document_types` is the optional 11 types of corresponding labels, which includes all types by default. You can also specify one or more types to be evaluated, please separate multiple types with spaces; `--download_dir` specifies the path where the json file is saved.

```
cd evaluate_tool
python markdown_calculate.py --tool_name tool_name --download_dir ../datasets/ --document_types <document_types> --results xx.json
```

# Demo

The following is a demo of the evaluation of the `marker` tool in the document type of academic_literature.
```
cd evaluate_tool
python clean_photo.py --tool_name annotations --download_dir ../datasets/
python clean_photo.py --tool_name marker --download_dir ../datasets/
python markdown_calculate.py --tool_name marker --download_dir ../datasets/ --results result.json --document_types academic_literature 
```
Here [result.json](evaluate_tool/result.json) are the results: The result.json file contains scores for each PDF file, scores for the selected document_types, and the overall average score.

# Known Issues
- The influence of line breaks and spaces on edit distance is temporarily filtered out
- The latex version of the formula is inconsistent, and the influence is temporarily ignored
- Pandoc may fail to convert ocrmath and nogout to latex tables;
- Nogout outputs mmd
